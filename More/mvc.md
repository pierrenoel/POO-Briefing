# MCV
MVC is the main design pattern of all the time. A lot of applications are based on this design pattern. But what is the meaning of MCV?

## A short defintion
- M for the models
- V for the views
- C for the controllers

Ok, now I have those informations, what am I supposed to do? Well, let me explain you this design pattern using a schema, it will be more easy
to understand that topic.

The controller is the switcher who will activate the right switches to route the user to his destination. From the visitor's point of view, he requests a page from the controller and sends back a view according to certain parameters (does he have the authorization to access this page for example?).

### But why?
- To better organize its code strategically: the view only takes care of the display, the controller takes care of the user inputs and transmits them to the model.
- To respect a widely used convention
- To be able to work more efficiently in a team
- For event-driven communication between view, model and controller
It allows a composite structure: the view will be composed of several elements superimposed on each other, generated by the interactions between the user and the application.

### So?
- Model, which defines the data structure and communicate with the database
- View, which handles the interface between the application and the users
- Controller, which manages data flow and communicate between the Model and the View
