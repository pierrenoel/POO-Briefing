## Objects?

Let us have a look about object. An object in the current life can be a table, a car but even a human or an animal. The good thing is that's exactly the same ting in POO. 

Here is an example:

If we take an user, we can describe it like below: 

- first name
- last name
- email
- password 
- ...

We call that **the attributes** of an object (refer to the variables). But as we know, objects interact with each other by some action, we call them methods (refer to then functions)

If we take our user back, we can assign some actions:

- write an article
- comment 
- update the gallery
- ...

But we know the existence of an object but most of them are very different, we know that two people does not have the same email or password.
How can we differentiate them? 

We need to create a class.

```A class can define types of operations, or methods, that can be performed on a object```
